    "# Self-Improving Email Assistant\n",
    "\n",
    "AI agents promise to transform how we work, but there's often a gap between hype and reality: to truly act on our behalf, agents need to learn and remember our preferences for personalization. In this repo, we're going to show how to build self-improving and personalized agents from scratch using LangChain, LangGraph, and LangSmith. \n",
    " \n",
    "We're going to build an agent that can act an an e-mail assistant, because this is often a rather tedious task that could benefit from an AI assistant, but it requires a high level of personalization (e.g., what to respond to, what to ignore, what to schedule a meeting for, and how to respond). \n",
    "\n",
    "Below is an overview of the email assistant we'll build with 1) the agent architecture (LangGraph), 2) testing (LangSmith), 3) human-in-the-loop (Agent Inbox), and 4) memory (LangMem). The notebooks are organized in the order of the steps, so you can follow along and accompanying completed code is in the `src/email_assistant` directory.\n",

    "## What are Agents?\n",
    "\n",
    "[Agents](https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraph/tutorials/workflows/) are systems where language models (LLMs) dynamically direct their own processes and tool usage. Unlike workflows with predefined paths, agents can make decisions about which actions to take based on their understanding of a task. Agents are particularly valuable for open-ended problems like email management, where it's difficult to predict the *exact* steps needed in advance: some emails can be responded to directly and some need coordination with tools (e.g, scheduling a meeting).\n",
    "\n",
    "![agent-img](img/agent.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Tool Definition\n",
    "\n",
    " As you will see, agents are typically implemented [using tool calling in a loop](https://python.langchain.com/docs/concepts/tool_calling/). Tools let agents interact with their environment. In LangChain/Graph, tools are easy to define: we can just use Python functions with the [@tool decorator](https://python.langchain.com/docs/concepts/tools/) or [MCP servers](https://github.com/langchain-ai/langchain-mcp-adapters). Let's start by defining some simple tools that an email assistant will use with the `@tool` decorator:"

    "\n",
    "The complete flow of our email assistant agent:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. An email arrives and is passed to the agent as a message\n",
    "2. The LLM analyzes the email and decides which tool to use\n",
    "3. If the LLM calls the `triage_email` tool, the classification is stored\n",
    "4. The agent continues reasoning and acting until it calls `Done`\n",
    "5. The final state includes the messages and any classification decision\n",
    "\n",
    "This implementation demonstrates a tool calling agent that alternates between reasoning (LLM decisions) and acting (tool execution) to accomplish complex tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Workflows vs. Agents\n",
    "\n",
    "We can see that it's easy to build an agent using LangGraph. But, what if we want to add more tools? You'll notice that the agent's prompt and scope of control grows as the number of tools / decisions it oversees increases. When we think about our application, we *always* want to triage incoming emails. So, we know that the first step is always going to be a triage step. Why not set up our application so that the first step is always the triage step? This is the motivation for the concept of a [workflow](https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraph/how-tos/workflows/)!  \n",
    "\n",
    "### Workflows\n",
    "- Have predefined code paths and decision logic\n",
    "- LLMs are components used for specific tasks\n",
    "- Best for structured problems with clear procedures, but not open-ended\n",
    "- Predictable behavior with explicit control flow\n",
    "\n",
    "### Agents\n",
    "- LLMs drive the decision-making process\n",
    "- Dynamically choose which tools to use\n",
    "- Best for open-ended problems where we can't enumerate the steps  \n",
    "- More flexible but potentially less reliable\n",
    "\n",
    "![agent_workflow_img](img/agent_workflow.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Combing the two\n",
    "We can use LangGraph to build a routing step prior to the agent, which handles the triage decision. This has some benefits, including separation of concerns. The triage router only focuses on the triage decision, while the agent focuses *only* on the response. As we'll see, this *separation of concerns* is useful because we'll add more tools to our agent. Breaking out the triage decision frees up some \"cognitive resources\" for the agent to focus only on the response. \n",
    "\n",
    "### The Triage Router\n",
    "\n",
    "Our email assistant implementation uses a router pattern. The router analyzes the email and makes a critical decision: should we respond, notify, or ignore? Based on this decision, it directs the flow either to the response agent or directly to the end state. We use [Command](https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraph/how-tos/command/) objects in LangGraph to both update the state and select the next node to visit.\n",
