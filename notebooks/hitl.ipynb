    "Its job is to examine the tool calls that the LLM wants to make and determine which ones need human review before execution. Here's how it works:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Tool Selection**: The handler maintains a list of \"HITL tools\" that require human approval:\n",
    "   - `write_email`: Since sending emails has significant external impact\n",
    "   - `schedule_meeting`: Since scheduling meetings affects calendars\n",
    "   - `Question`: Since asking users questions requires direct interaction\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Direct Execution**: Tools not in the HITL list (like `check_calendar_availability`) are executed immediately without interruption. This allows low-risk operations to proceed automatically.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Context Preparation**: For tools requiring review, the handler:\n",
    "   - Retrieves the original email for context\n",
    "   - Formats the tool call details for clear display\n",
    "   - Configures which interaction types are allowed for each tool type\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Interrupt Creation**: The handler creates a structured interrupt request with:\n",
    "   - The action name and arguments\n",
    "   - Configuration for allowed interaction types\n",
    "   - A description that includes both the original email and the proposed action\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Response Processing**: After the interrupt, the handler processes the human response:\n",
    "   - **Accept**: Executes the tool with original arguments\n",
    "   - **Edit**: Updates the tool call with edited arguments and then executes\n",
    "   - **Ignore**: Cancels the tool execution\n",
    "   - **Response**: Records feedback without execution\n",
    "\n",
    "This handler ensures humans have oversight of all significant actions while allowing routine operations to proceed automatically. \n",
    "\n",
    "The ability to edit tool arguments (like email content or meeting details) gives users precise control over the assistant's actions.\n",

    "1. First, we test feedback for meeting scheduling:\n",

    "   - The agent incorporates this feedback into a revised proposal\n",
    "   - The user then accepts the revised meeting schedule\n",

    "2. Second, we test feedback for email drafting:\n",
    "   - The user requests a shorter, less formal email with a specific closing statement\n",
    "   - The agent completely rewrites the email according to this guidance\n",
    "   - The user accepts the new draft\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Lastly, we test feedback for questions:\n",
    "   - For the brunch invitation, the user answers the question with additional context\n",
    "   - The agent uses this information to draft an appropriate email response\n",
    "   - The workflow proceeds with the user's input integrated\n",
    "\n",
    "The \"response\" capability bridges the gap between acceptance and editing - users can guide the agent without having to write the full content themselves. This is especially powerful for:\n",
