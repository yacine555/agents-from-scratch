# Agents From Scratch 

The repo is a guide to building agents from scratch. It builds up to an ["ambient"](https://blog.langchain.dev/introducing-ambient-agents/) agent that can manage your email with connection to the Gmail API. It's grouped into 4 sections, each with a notebook and accompanying code in the `src/email_assistant` directory. These section build from the basics of agents, to agent evaluation, to human-in-the-loop, and finally to memory. These all come together in an agent that you can deploy, and the principles can be applied to other agents across a wide range of tasks.

## Environment Setup 

### Python Version

* Ensure you're using Python 3.11 or later. 
* This version is required for optimal compatibility with LangGraph. 

```shell
python3 --version
```

### API Keys

* If you don't have an OpenAI API key, you can sign up [here](https://openai.com/index/openai-api/).
* Sign up for LangSmith [here](https://smith.langchain.com/).
* Generate a LangSmith API key.

### Set Environment Variables

* Create a `.env` file in the root directory:
```shell
# Copy the .env.example file to .env
cp .env.example .env
```

* Edit the `.env` file with the following:
```shell
LANGSMITH_API_KEY=your_langsmith_api_key
LANGSMITH_TRACING=true
LANGSMITH_PROJECT="interrupt-workshop"
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key
```

* You can also set the environment variables in your terminal:
```shell
export LANGSMITH_API_KEY=your_langsmith_api_key
export LANGSMITH_TRACING=true
export OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key
```

### Create a virtual environment and activate it

```shell
$ python3 -m venv .venv
$ source .venv/bin/activate
# Ensure you have a recent version of pip (required for editable installs with pyproject.toml)
$ python3 -m pip install --upgrade pip
# Install the package in editable mode
$ pip install -e .
```

> **⚠️ IMPORTANT**: Do not skip the `pip install -e .` step! This editable install is **required** for the notebooks to work correctly. Without it, you'll get `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'email_assistant'` errors when running the notebooks.

## Structure 

The repo is organized into the 4 sections, with a notebook for each and accompanying code in the `src/email_assistant` directory.

### Preface: LangGraph 101
For a brief introduction to LangGraph and some of the concepts used in this repo, see the [LangGraph 101 notebook](notebooks/langgraph_101.ipynb). This notebook explains the basics of chat models, tool calling, agents vs workflows, LangGraph nodes / edges / memory, and LangGraph Studio.

### Building an agent 
* Notebook: [notebooks/agent.ipynb](/notebooks/agent.ipynb)
* Code: [src/email_assistant/email_assistant.py](/src/email_assistant/email_assistant.py)

![overview-agent](notebooks/img/overview_agent.png)

This notebook shows how to build the email assistant, combining an [email triage step](https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraph/tutorials/workflows/) with an agent that handles the email response. You can see the linked code for the full implementation in `src/email_assistant/email_assistant.py`.

### Evaluation 
* Notebook: [notebooks/evaluation.ipynb](/notebooks/evaluation.ipynb)

![overview-eval](notebooks/img/overview_eval.png)

This notebook introduces evaluation with an email dataset in [eval/email_dataset.py](/eval/email_dataset.py). It shows how to run evaluations using Pytest and the LangSmith `evaluate` API. It runs evaluation for emails responses using LLM-as-a-judge as well as evaluations for tools calls and triage decisions.

### Human-in-the-loop 
* Notebook: [notebooks/hitl.ipynb](/notebooks/hitl.ipynb)
* Code: [src/email_assistant/email_assistant_hitl.py](/src/email_assistant/email_assistant_hitl.py)

![overview-hitl](notebooks/img/overview_hitl.png)

This notebooks shows how to add human-in-the-loop (HITL), allowing the user to review specific tool calls (e.g., send email, schedule meeting). For this, we use [Agent Inbox](https://github.com/langchain-ai/agent-inbox) as an interface for human in the loop. You can see the linked code for the full implementation in [src/email_assistant/email_assistant_hitl.py](/src/email_assistant/email_assistant_hitl.py).

### Memory  
* Notebook: [notebooks/memory.ipynb](/notebooks/memory.ipynb)
* Code: [src/email_assistant/email_assistant_hitl_memory.py](/src/email_assistant/email_assistant_hitl_memory.py)

![overview-memory](notebooks/img/overview_memory.png)  

This notebook shows how to add memory to the email assistant, allowing it to learn from user feedback and adapt to preferences over time. The memory-enabled assistant ([email_assistant_hitl_memory.py](/src/email_assistant/email_assistant_hitl_memory.py)) uses the [LangGraph Store](https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraph/concepts/memory/#long-term-memory) to persist memories. You can see the linked code for the full implementation in [src/email_assistant/email_assistant_hitl_memory.py](/src/email_assistant/email_assistant_hitl_memory.py).

## Connecting to APIs  

The above notebooks using mock email and calendar tools. 

### Gmail Integration 

Set up Google API credentials following the instructions in [Gmail Tools README](src/email_assistant/tools/gmail/README.md).

The README also explains how to deploy the graph to LangGraph Platform.

The full implementation of the Gmail integration is in [src/email_assistant/email_assistant_hitl_memory_gmail.py](/src/email_assistant/email_assistant_hitl_memory_gmail.py).

## Running Tests

The repository includes an automated test suite to evaluate the email assistant implementations. Tests verify correct tool usage and response quality using LangSmith for tracking.

### Running Tests with [run_all_tests.py](/tests/run_all_tests.py)

The test runner supports testing different implementations of the email assistant:

```shell
# Run tests for the default implementation (email_assistant)
python tests/run_all_tests.py

# Run tests for a specific implementation
python tests/run_all_tests.py --implementation email_assistant_hitl

# Run tests for all available implementations
python tests/run_all_tests.py --all

# Add a specific experiment name for LangSmith tracking
python tests/run_all_tests.py --experiment-name "Custom Test Run"
```

### Test Results

Test results are logged to LangSmith under the project name specified in your `.env` file (`LANGSMITH_PROJECT`). This provides:
- Visual inspection of agent traces
- Detailed evaluation metrics
- Comparison of different agent implementations

### Available Test Implementations

The available implementations for testing are:
- `email_assistant` - Basic email assistant
- `email_assistant_hitl` - Human-in-the-loop version
- `email_assistant_hitl_memory` - Memory-enabled HITL version
- `email_assistant_hitl_memory_gmail` - Gmail-integrated version

### Testing Notebooks

You can also run tests to verify all notebooks execute without errors:

```shell
# Run all notebook tests
python tests/test_notebooks.py

# Or run via pytest
pytest tests/test_notebooks.py -v
```

## Future Extensions

Add [LangMem](https://langchain-ai.github.io/langmem/) to manage memories:
* Manage a collection of background memories. 
* Add memory tools that can look up facts in the background memories.
